# DuckDB Deltatable Extension

This is a purely experimental extension, not supported by the DuckDB Labs/Foundation, and is not suitable for production use. 

Built on the experimental [DuckDB extension framework](https://github.com/Mause/duckdb-extension-framework)

Builds available in the Github actions [artifacts](https://nightly.link/Mause/duckdb-deltatable-extension/workflows/cmake/main/extension), though you'll probably want to build your own copy to match your version of DuckDB
